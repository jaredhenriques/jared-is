Over the last week a lot of people have been asking me about my latest project Rhythm Coffee. Mainly the questions comes out like this, “So what’s the deal with this coffee thing?” so I thought I would answer that in a public manner. In short my answer is that,

"I love coffee and I want to learn more about it, also I just really miss creating."

It was about 2 years ago that I wound down my clothing company and in that time I have really felt a loss of identity. I believe that I was made to create and it has been hard to believing day to day in a space where I am not creating. Essentially I was an entrepreneur without a project, which would mean I am not an entrepreneur. I desperately wish I could enjoy working for someone else because I think I would be really good at it and I would have way more time and money, so that would be fun. But, alas I have an awesome job at the fastest growing tech company around and I hate it. It’s not that the job is bad, the job is awesome! The company is incredible and anyone in my position should be beyond ecstatic at the oppourtunity they have been given. So why do I feel so trapped? I touched on it briefly in my latest blog but I knew that I needed to do something. The amazing part of my job is that I work from home and so that affords me the oppourtunity to leverage my spare time better. Another perk of working at my job is I really know how to start an online store, because it’s what we do.

When it came to selling the coffee I looked into drop shipping because well all you need to do is drive sales and marketing and then someone else deals with the inventory and logistics of shipping for you. Seems like a hands off operation that costs almost nothing to start. The more and more I looked into it, I knew it wasn’t for me. I love to be involved with the product from start to finish as much as I can. I believe in going above and beyond and making sure that every time someone purchases they are getting something of quality. Great now I needed to find some coffee. I had spoken with Mark at Velvet Sunrise, a roaster in Stouffville earlier this year and he mentioned that he would supply for me, that we would have the ability to do our own roasts with him.

It took a few months to pull the trigger but last week we did it. I told mark that I would order 10 bags of the two roasts we settled with and I built the website. I have been asked a lot of questions about coffee that I am excited to research more into. I believe in brewing at home because it is cheaper, generates less waste and it tastes better. I am a coffee drinker and I am selling the coffee that I brew at home everyday. I like it enough to drink at home and I think you will to. If you have any questions or you wanna help out in anyway shoot me a message at hello@rhythmcoffee.com.

Cool.

Over the last week a lot of people have been asking me about my latest project [Rhythm Coffee](http://rhythmcoffee.com/). Mainly the questions comes out like this, “So what’s the deal with this coffee thing?” I thought I would answer that here so you know. In short my answer is;

### "I love coffee and I want to learn more about it. Also I just really miss creating."

It was about 2 years ago that I wound down my clothing company and in that time I have really felt a loss of identity. I believe that I was made to create and in the last couple years I haven't been. Essentially I was an entrepreneur without a project, which would mean I am not an entrepreneur. The amazing part of my job is that I work from home which allows me to leverage my spare time better. Another perk of working at my job is I really know how to start an online store, because it’s what we do. There was no excuse for me not to sell something. I love coffee so I decided that was it.

When it came to selling the coffee I looked into drop shipping because well all you need to do is drive sales and marketing, while someone else deals with the inventory and logistics of shipping for you. A hands-off operation that costs almost nothing to start. Seemingly perfect for most, but the more and more I looked into it I knew it wasn’t for me. I love to be involved with the product from start to finish as much as I can. I believe in going above and beyond and making sure that every time someone purchases they are getting something of quality. Great now I needed to find some coffee. I had spoken with Mark at Velvet Sunrise, a roaster in Stouffville earlier this year and he mentioned that he would supply for me, that we would have the ability to do our own roasts with him. I tasted many different beans and roasts and I loved the coffee, I was brewing his coffee at home exclusively.

It took a few months to pull the trigger but last week we did it. I told mark that I would order 10 bags of the two roasts we settled on and I built the website, took all the photos last week and ta da, a coffee company. I have been asked a lot of questions about coffee that I am excited to research more into. I believe in brewing at home because it is cheaper, generates less waste and it tastes better. I am a coffee drinker and I am selling the coffee that I brew at home every day. I like it enough to drink at home and I think you will too.

**So in short; I started a coffee company. I am selling it because it allows me to keep learning more and more about business and coffee itself. You should [buy some](http://rhythmcoffee.com/collections/the-coffee) because it's good.**
