I was working at a high-end audio equipment company when I had a pivotal conversation over lunch with a product development colleague.

That's when I discovered a significant misalignment: the marketing team was targeting younger, tech-savvy consumers who wanted smart home integration, while the product team was building speakers for audiophiles seeking pure sound fidelity.

Two different departments, both passionate and skilled, were working towards completely different goals.

The issue wasn't a lack of talent. It was an absence of unified brand strategy to guide organizational decisions.

This experience prompted me to explore brand strategy deeply, eventually leading me to found Renga, my branding studio.

Brand strategy functions as an organizational North Star—aligning product development with marketing, sales with customer service, and leadership with employees.

Strong branding aligns organizations, guides business decisions, drives resonant innovation, creates consistent customer experiences, and builds cultures that attract talent.
