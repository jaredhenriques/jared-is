What values and perspectives should I instill in children facing an unpredictable future? Rather than focusing on specific career paths or traditional success metrics, I'm emphasizing timeless principles.

## Key Values

**Humility and curiosity** — maintaining conviction while remaining receptive to new ideas.

**Agency and adaptability** — understanding one can influence circumstances while staying flexible.

**Service and generosity** — recognizing fulfillment comes through helping others.

## Core Philosophy

Rather than predicting the future or charting a predetermined path for my children, I'm focusing parental guidance on developing mental flexibility and resilience. The best thing I can pass down isn't just knowledge, but a way of seeing the world that balances openness with intentionality.

Traditional institutional structures—schooling, career ladders, conventional success—are shifting, making adaptable thinking more valuable than specialized knowledge alone. My role is to accompany children through change rather than control outcomes.
