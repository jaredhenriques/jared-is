I've helped design pitch decks that have raised over $100 million. Here's what I've learned.

A pitch deck's purpose isn't to guarantee funding. It's to allow the investor to empathize with the problem and pique their curiosity.

## The Opening Structure

1. **Title Slide** — Company name and funding round
2. **One-liner** — Clear statement of what the business does
3. **Problem** (2-4 slides) — Frame the core issue in relatable terms
4. **Solution** — Declarative statement addressing the problem

The first 3-6 slides is where you will win or lose the attention of the investor.

## Common Mistakes

- Attempting to convince investors this is a good investment rather than demonstrating sound business logic
- Anticipating every possible question instead of sparking curiosity
- Including excessive information that dilutes the core message
- Constantly revising the deck after each meeting

## The Right Mindset

Think of pitching as a first date. Present a hypothesis and seek partners to test it—not deliver final answers seeking silent agreement.

Your job is to start a conversation, not end one.
