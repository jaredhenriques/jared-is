As I transition into a full-time employee position, I'm grappling with releasing the entrepreneurial identity that has long defined me. My sense of purpose, ambition, and self-worth have been intertwined with business ownership.

I acknowledge mixed emotions about this shift. While anticipating stability, clarity, and reduced pressure from joining an established team, I wrestle with concerns about losing autonomy and decision-making control I've grown accustomed to.

I'm genuinely curious about discovering who I'll become without entrepreneurship as my primary identifier. Will structured employment feel liberating or restrictive? Will new strengths emerge in this different context?

The central reflection centers on identity exploration beyond the "founder" label. I'm contemplating how aspects of myself may have been overshadowed by entrepreneurial responsibilities, and how my definitions of ambition and success might evolve when professional stakes change.

This transition is deeply personal, not merely professional. I'm willing to hold my identity more loosely and embrace uncertainty during this pivotal season.
