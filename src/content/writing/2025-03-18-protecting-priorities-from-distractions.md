I'm reflecting on the beginning of my vacation as an opportunity to disconnect and be present. As someone who typically fills every moment with productive tasks, I find vacations challenging rather than relaxing.

## Disconnecting to Reconnect

Previously, vacations came with mental baggage about pending work and obligations, making genuine relaxation nearly impossible. Now with fewer commitments, I'm confronting my discomfort with simply being present without an agenda.

## Priorities vs. Distractions

Removing distractions reveals how frequently people sacrifice meaningful aspects of life for immediate tasks and short-term comfort. Without a looming task list, I'm discovering how difficult it truly is to embrace rest and leisure.

This vacation represents a rare opportunity to practice protecting priorities authentically—without the pressure of productivity or the familiar distraction of tasks I feel compelled to complete.
